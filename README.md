# Gartic On Demand

A discord bot for asynchronous Gartic Phone custom modes.

Currently implemented modes:
- Rossmode - First 4 rounds create attributes, 5th round create a character with given attributes.
- Evolution - First round create a base evolution, rounds 2-3 evolve the provided creature.

The project was halted due to player inactivity (which lead to my decreased motivation to work on it).

# About

The bot is made using `poise` framework, uses a discord server as image storage/interface and `surrealdb` as the games database.
